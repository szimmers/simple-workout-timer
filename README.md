# Simple Workout Timer

SWT is an iOS HealthKit app whose purpose is to simply provide
a timer while the user works out and write the workout back
to Apple Health.

Unlike fussier apps, it does not require the user to pre-configure
a workout or follow any regimen. It does allow the user to make up
their workout on the fly, which is nice when, say, the treadmill
is being used and you head to the weights.

SWT is heavily based on [this Prancercise app tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/159019).

The intent is to provide myself an introduction to XCode and Swift
programming as well as give myself the kind of workout app I want.
